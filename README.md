# To-Do-List
In this project, I have created three branches:

1. Frontend Branch (React): This branch handles the frontend, which is developed using React for building the user interface and managing tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting items in the To-Do list.


2. Master Branch (Node.js): The master branch contains the backend built with Node.js, handling the server-side logic and API operations.


3. Postman Link and Screenshots: A Postman collection link is attached for API testing, along with screenshots for better reference.
